      <p id="abt">I'm a 22 year old Software Engineer, currently in my 4th year of getting my BS in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Chicago. 
      I am originally from Colorado, but have since moved full time to Chicago to pursue my degree. In my free time I mostly enjoy playing video games, 
      and have spent the last 3 years competing on the IIT Counter Strike: Global Offensive team. Video games is what got me into the world of computers, 
      my old boss once said "Video games are like a gateway drug to computer science" and honestly he seems to have been telling the truth. 
      Video games ignited my passion for working with computers, and what started as a game design hobby has now introduced me into a whole new world to explore as a career.
