      <h2>Database Project</h2>
      <p id="abt">This was a project to create an application for an imaginary online grocery store. We used PostgreSQL for the database. Our goal was
        to implement an interface, however we ran out of time and decided a functioning application with a working database took priority over an interface
        for this project. This was completed as group project with Stephanie Bae and Adhish Acharya.

        The video showcasing our final project can be found here: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVHKdGwwWdg">Database Video</a>

      <h2>Stock App</h2>
      <p id="abt">This is an app I made for a class in Fall 2019. It is a stock watching app meaning you can add stocks to your watch list as well as remove them.
        The screenshots below showcase the design of the app as well as the process of adding a new stock to your watch list. The data for the app was taken from a stock
        API.

      <h2>Rewards App</h2>
      <p id="abt">This is an app I made for a class in Fall 2019. Rewards app for an imaginary company. The app allows users to create accounts, and send their
        "rewards points" to other member if they believe they deserve them, along with a note about why they believe this person was deserving.
        Unfortunately this app utilized an API that is no longer available. Due to this I am not able to show screenshots of the app fully functioning.
        Instead, the screenshots below show the functioning login and profile creation screens, and the rest of the app is shown through screenshots of the layout
        shown on android studio.
