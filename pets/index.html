      <p id="abt">This is an app I made for a class in Fall 2019. It is a stock watching app meaning you can add stocks to your watch list as well as remove them.
        The screenshots below showcase the design of the app as well as the process of adding a new stock to your watch list. The data for the app was taken from a stock
        API.
