      <p id="abt">This is an app I made for a class in Fall 2019. Rewards app for an imaginary company. The app allows users to create accounts, and send their
        "rewards points" to other member if they believe they deserve them, along with a note about why they believe this person was deserving.
        Unfortunately this app utilized an API that is no longer available. Due to this I am not able to show screenshots of the app fully functioning.
        Instead, the screenshots below show the functioning login and profile creation screens, and the rest of the app is shown through screenshots of the layout
        shown on android studio.
